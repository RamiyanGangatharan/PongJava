# PongJava (AWT Edition)

**Author:** Ramiyan Gangatharan

**Overview:**  
PongJava is a low-level Java implementation of the classic Pong game, built entirely using AWT. This project focuses on 
understanding manual rendering, window management, and fundamental game architecture without relying on Swing or other external frameworks.

**Features:**
- Core game mechanics of Pong
- UI built with Panels, Labels, and Buttons
- Manual rendering setup
- Placeholder for future enhancements like a full game loop

**Purpose:**  
This project is designed as a learning tool to explore how games can be built from the ground up in Java. 
It demonstrates how to manage graphics, handle input, and structure a basic game engine without high-level libraries.

**Future Plans:**
- Implement a complete game loop with smooth rendering
- Add scoring and game state management
- Enhance UI and visual feedback for players

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the Java files using `javac`.
3. Run the main class with `java GameScreen`.
4. Enjoy Pong in its simplest, low-level Java form!
