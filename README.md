# PongJava
This project, Pong (AWT Edition) by Ramiyan Gangatharan, is a low-level Java Pong implementation using only AWT. 
It explores manual rendering, window management, and core game architecture without Swing or external frameworks. 
The UI uses Panels, Labels, and Buttons, with plans to add full rendering and a game loop.
